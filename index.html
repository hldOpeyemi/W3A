                    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. 
                    It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at 
                    the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and 
                    have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. 
                    <mark>A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions 
                    usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates.</mark>
                    The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities 
                    occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.
